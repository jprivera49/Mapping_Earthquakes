# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary
This project shows earthquakes and the techtonic plates they are located in.  The earthquakes are colored and have larger circles to indicate magnitude levels.  The website is able to show three types of maps: street, satellite street, and light.  Earthquakes and Techtonic Plates can be selected or unselected.  

D3.JSON, GeoJSON, Javascript, HTML, and CSS were used to create the map and the layers.
